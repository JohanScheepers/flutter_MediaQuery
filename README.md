# How MediaQuery improves user experience:

## MediaQuery
is a crucial widget for providing a better user experience by allowing your app to adapt to different screen sizes, orientations, and device capabilities. Here's how:
Responsive Design: MediaQuery helps you build responsive layouts that adjust to different screen sizes and resolutions. You can query the screen's width, height, and pixel density to create layouts that work well on phones, tablets, and even desktops.

## Orientation Changes:
MediaQuery allows you to detect if a device is in portrait or landscape mode. You can then rearrange your layout to optimize for the user's viewing orientation.
Theme Customization: You can use MediaQuery to detect the user's system theme (light or dark mode) and apply the appropriate styling to your app.

## Device-Specific Features:
MediaQuery can provide information about the device's capabilities, like whether it has a notch or a physical keyboard. This allows you to optimize your app for specific device characteristics
